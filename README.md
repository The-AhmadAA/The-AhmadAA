**Hi, I’m @The-AhmadAA** 
- I’m in my second/third year of a Software Engineering undergraduate degree. I've primarily coded in C and Python, with some experience with Java, Unix and MySQL in phpMyAdmin.
- The coursework I've enjoyed the most has been embedded system design, Real-time operating systems (FreeRTOS), and functional programming with Haskell.

- I'm also tinkering with:
  -  Maintaining and updating the website for UQ Mechatronics and Robotics Society
  -  Learning Javascript, and planning to progress onto React and Node.js. 
  -  ROS 1 (Noetic) and CAN logging for UQ Racing
 
- Interested in embedded systems, robotics, cybersecurity and machine learning.
