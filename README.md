**Hi, I’m @The-AhmadAA** 
- I’m in my second/third year of a Software Engineering undergraduate degree. I've primarily coded in *C* and *Python*, with some experience with Java, Unix and MySQL in phpMyAdmin.
My current coursework is delving into embedded system design, functional programming, and human-computer interaction.

- I'm also tinkering with javascript, and plan to progress onto React and Node.js.
- Also interested in embedded systems, robotics, cybersecurity and machine learning. To those ends, I'm involved in robotics projects and CTFs wherever possible.
