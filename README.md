- Hi, I’m @The-AhmadAA
- I’m a first/second year Software Engineering student. I've coded in C and Python, and currently diving deeper into C, Java, Unix and MySQL.
- I'm also in the early stages of tackling javascript, with plans to attack React and Node.js
- Also interested in embedded systems, robotics, cybersecurity and machine learning. To those ends, I'm involved in robotics projects and CTFs wherever possible.
