**Hi, I’m @The-AhmadAA** 
- I’m in my second/third year of a Software Engineering undergraduate degree. I've primarily coded in C and Python, with some experience with Java, Unix and MySQL in phpMyAdmin.
My current coursework is delving into embedded system design, Real-time operating systems (FreeRTOS), functional programming with Haskell, and human-computer interaction.

- I'm also tinkering with:
  -  Maintaining and updating the website for UQ Mechatronics and Robotics Society
  -  Learning Javascript, and planning to progress onto React and Node.js. 
  -  MATLAB and some of the ML and CV toolboxes
  -  ROS 1 (Humble) and CAN logging for UQ Racing
 
- Interested in embedded systems, robotics, cybersecurity and machine learning. To those ends, I'm involved in robotics projects and CTFs wherever possible.
