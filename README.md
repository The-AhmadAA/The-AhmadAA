- Hi, I’m **@The-AhmadAA**
- I’m a second/third year Software Engineering student. I've coded in C and Python, and currently diving deeper into C, Java, Unix and MySQL in phpMyAdmin.
- I'm also in the early stages of tackling javascript, with plans to progress onto React and Node.js
- Also interested in embedded systems, robotics, cybersecurity and machine learning. To those ends, I'm involved in robotics projects and CTFs wherever possible.
